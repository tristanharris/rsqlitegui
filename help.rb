  Ruby SQLite GUI Help
  --------------------

  Usage: rsqlitegui [options] [database_file]
         ruby rsqlitegui.rb [options] [database_file]

  Options:
    -s2, --sqlite2
        Uses the sqlite2 store instead of sqlite3
    -h, --help
        Displays this

  Important notes:
    Operations on the database are not like operations
    on a text file. Changes are immediate and saved to
    the database as soon as an action is performed.
    Most importantly, there is NO undo function.

#    Also, having an id (or other primary key) column
    is very important to ActiveRecord. By default when
    creating a table in the GUI, a primary key is
    created for you if you haven't specified one, but
    if you are performing your own raw SQL queries for
    creating custom tables, forgetting a primary key
    could cause unexpected problems. The same goes for
    editing existing databases without primary keys.
